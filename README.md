# Creating-and-Managing-Active-Directory
My classmates and I created and presented a PowerPoint on setting up Active Directory and hardening Active Directory. 
The beginning describes using Azure cloud to set up a virtual machine, network security group, and resource group for the Active Directory server.
The next part includes configuring and deploying Active Directory. We also created organizational units, users, and groups. 
Finally, we researched common attack vectors used and how to harden the system against those threats.

Here is the link to the presentation with the speaker notes.
